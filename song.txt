We found ourselves atop of a mountain peak
The air was thin as a beggar’s sleeve
The city lights were miles away
The hush was as thick as your winter coat
And you wrote our names in the morning
Snow with fallen twigs and berries saved

Well, don’t be scared of avalanches
Tucked up in my snowy branches
I will
Oh I will
Oh I will
I will keep you safe
